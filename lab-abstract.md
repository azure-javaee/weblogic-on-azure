# WebLogic on Azure Linux Virtual Machines Workshop

Microsoft and Oracle have partnered to provide a set of robust and up-to-date solutions for running WebLogic on Azure Linux virtual machines. These solutions and the associated guidance will allow Azure users to much more easily migrate WebLogic workloads to Azure. The solutions support simple use cases such as easily creating a single working WebLogic instance. They also support common use cases such as clustering, load-balancing, database connectivity, consolidated logging, caching, and directory server integration. In the future the solutions will also encompass ensuring WebLogic runs as easily as possible on the Azure Kubernetes Service.

This hands-on workshop will give you a firsthand taste of the use cases supported by the solutions, using a representative but simple application. At the end of the workshop you will be prepared to confidently start migrating WebLogic workloads to Azure.
