# WebLogic on Azure Linux Virtual Machines

Microsoft and Oracle have partnered to provide a set of robust and up-to-date solutions for running WebLogic on Azure Linux virtual machines. These solutions and the associated guidance will allow Azure users to much more easily migrate WebLogic workloads to Azure. The solutions support simple use cases such as easily creating a single working WebLogic instance. They also support common use cases such as clustering, load-balancing, database connectivity, consolidated logging, caching, and directory server integration.

This introductory session will overview these solutions including a demo. We will also cover the longer-term roadmap for WebLogic on Azure including ensuring WebLogic runs just as well on the Azure Kubernetes Service.
